What would jQuery Mobile be like if you took out all of the crap-browser support (looking at you, IE-every-version) and the esoteric features that most apps never use? That's the driving force behind Caress.

This is an _extremely stripped-down_ reimplementation of jQuery Mobile. And it's only just getting started, so there's really not much to it yet.
