What would jQuery Mobile be like if you took out all of the crap-browser support (looking at you, IE-every-version) and the esoteric features that most apps never use? That's the driving force behind Caress.

This is an _extremely stripped-down_ reimplementation of jQuery Mobile. And it's only just getting started, so there's really not much to it yet.

* [DEMO!](http://atuttle.github.com/caress.js/)

Other stuff:
* Easily themable: Just edit the LESS (broken down into THEME and STRUCTURE) sections, and recompile it.
* CSS is currently just 3KB minified; 1.1KB gzipped!

## Patches welcome!
