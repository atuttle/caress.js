What would jQuery Mobile be like if you took out all of the crap-browser support (looking at you, IE-every-version) and the esoteric features that most apps never use? It could be an extremely lightweight, and simple to use framework for defining a touch-based UI using nothing but HTML and CSS. That's the driving force behind Caress.

This is an _extremely stripped-down_ reimplementation of jQuery Mobile. And it's only just getting started, so there's really not much to it yet.

### Build Status
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/atuttle/caress.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/atuttle/caress.js)

### Other stuff

* Demo you say? [DEMO!](http://atuttle.github.com/caress.js/) (I am not a designer...)
* Easily themable: Just edit the LESS (broken down into THEME and STRUCTURE) sections, and recompile it.
* Caress' CSS is currently just 4kb minified; 1kb gzipped! (Whereas jQuery Mobile's CSS is 61kb minified, 9kb gzipped)

### Pull Requests welcome!

### Credit Where Credit Is Due

I've cribbed much from other open source projects:

* [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) - inspiration, occasional bits of CSS, and a few images
* [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) - all of the Ruby, Rake, etc that makes Continuous Integration on Travis-CI work.

Thank you!
